This project was created by Chad Sundberg, Ben Marino, Azmat Naseem, and Sumya Oishe in completion of the final project for ENCH 670 at UMBC.
This project involes modeling fate and transport of PCBs in the water column of the Anacostia River in Washington DC, and modeling the output of a hypothetical biosensor
to determine if biosensor technology is a viable option for detecting and measuring PCBs in water systems.
